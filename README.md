- 👋 Hi, I’m James
- 👀 I’m interested in Humane Technology - supporting our well-being and shared information environment.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Front-End Engineering at Codecademy. (85% complete)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that are not focused on attention-mining and not ad-based.
- 📫 How to reach me: contact me through my website: https://jameskeezer.dev
